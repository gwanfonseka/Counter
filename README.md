## Usage & Testing guidelines

- Simplified code with a component `Counter`
- Usage of `useReducer` to manage multiple actions to do changes to the state
- `Eslint` has been configured to provide an error free quality code
- Counter value is allowed to increase upto 10 maximum
- Trying to increase the value more that 10 will prompt an alert
- Trying to decrease the value less than 0 will prompt an alert
- Resetting the counter will bring the counter value back to 0
